							<p>
								With 25 years of commercial experience, I specialise in creating
								applications that captivate millions of users. My journey
								combines a rich background in UX design with cutting-edge
								cross-platform software development skills. Hands-on development
								is my true calling, and as an introvert who loves to code, I
								wonâ€™t stop talking about the latest technological innovations.
							</p>

							<h3>What I can do?</h3>
							<p>
								I deliver. Be it design concepts or commercial shipping
								projects. I'm a great team player and communicator. Unless my
								code is broken, then best leave me alone.
							</p>
							<p>
								I'm all about bringing a human touch to technology. Apps should
								be performant, easy to use and delight. Accessibility, motion
								design, custom interactions and more are a hallmark of projects
								I have touched.
