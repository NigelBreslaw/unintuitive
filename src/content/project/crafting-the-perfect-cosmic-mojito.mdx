## Introduction

I wanted to have an open source project to demonstrate the latest tech I work with and how I put it all together to craete delightful modern applications.

With most of my work not being public or unsuitable to make open source I wanted to create a new project. Hence ‘Guardian Ghost’.

You can try the mobile web version [here](https://app.guardianghost.com/). For the best experience add a shortcut of the app to your phones homescreen so it will run without browser chrome. Just contact me if you want access to the iOS or Android beta. They are both in private access and as of May 2024 the app isn't publicly availiable. It has a demo mode so you don't need a Destiny 2 account to try it ou.

## React Native Universal app

At the heart of any great Mojito lies the zesty charm of limes. To create a cosmic twist, we source the finest limes from across the universe, ensuring a burst of citrusy freshness that's out of this world.

### Open Source

The entire project can be viewed over on [github](https://github.com/NigelBreslaw/guardian-ghost). I generate a documentation site from markdown files [here](https://docs.guardianghost.com/guides/monorepo/).

### Blazingly fast CI

My secret to a great [UX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience) is a great Developer Experience. I've hand crafted the entire project to be a monorepo with a CI pipeline and tech stack for rapid itteration. The main CI runs in under 30 seconds. This is excluding mobile builds, tests and benchmarks. This is for the entire monorepo and utilises the latest Rust based tooling such as lint and formatting via [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) which takes under a second. Turborepo is used for caching builds and test runs ensuring only projects and files that have changed are rebuilt or tested. 

### Automated dependency updates and security checks

Dependabot is used to keep the entire project upto date. This means everything is constantly migrated to the latest and greatest tech. React Native 0.74, React 18.3, Expo 51, Typescript 5.5, etc, etc. Web technology is constantly evolving and it's all too common to get stuck on outdated and unmaintained frameworks. Often resulting in difficult migrations when multiple outdated dependencies need updating.

The project also utilises CodeQL to check for security issues.

### Automated deployment to TestFlight, Google Play Store and Web

The entire project auto deploys to all the main platforms in under 20 minutes. Github actions deploy for web and Android. While Xcode Cloud deploys the latest beta app to TestFlight. Web takes 2 mins to deploy to CloudFlare, Android takes 10 minutes and iOS takes 20 (because Apple).

## Guardian Ghost

This is a universal app targeting iPhone, Android and mobile web. Tablet and desktop web are planned for after the summer. Although the first commit was in Decemember 2023, intial development was just setting up the environment and ensurign all aspects of deployment were automated. Serious app development started from the start of [February](https://github.com/NigelBreslaw/guardian-ghost/graphs/commit-activity) showing it's possible to buiild a React Native universal app in around 4 months.

### Architecture

The app is built with React Native 0.74, Expo 51, and Typescript. For state [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) is used because it does everything Redux does, but in far less code and with seamless async support. The main UI utilise React Navigation and React Native Gesture Handler. Dependencies have been kept to a [minimum](https://github.com/NigelBreslaw/guardian-ghost/blob/main/native/package.json) and as most 3rd party component libraries are either terrible, are difficult to customise or don't have universal support I have mostly hand rolled my own components.

### Blazingly fast

As of May 2024 the mobile app start time is under a second. The Android download is ~13MB, iOS ~ 20MB and web is ~2MB of bundle.
